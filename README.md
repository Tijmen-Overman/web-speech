# WebSpeech API

A simple test project to start working with the WebSpeech API.

## Good to know

The WebSpeech API is not fully supported by all browsers yet.
To look at the project effectively open it in the Chrome browser.

## Where to start

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the index.html file in Chrome.
3. Click on the microphone icon to start.
4. Allow the use of the microphone.
5. Say `Next` to move on to the next slide.
6. After 3 slides your speech will be displayed on the screen. First as an interim result and after a short period of time as the final result.
7. Once a final result is generated you can have the WebSpeech API speak the words you spoke.
8. Whenever you want to clear the final results and retry, click on the microphone icon again.
9. Enjoy!
